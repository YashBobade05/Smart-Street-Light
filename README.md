Smart Street Light |

Smart Street Light used for lighting street lights depending on the vehicles pass under it which helps in reduction of energy. Also the light can be provided on basis of environment and we can also have the eye on use of the lights by the graph provided online and have a known of how much energy is used and also the trafficking of cars on road.

• Design and developed a device or system using Node MCU / Raspberry Pi3, LDR sensor, IR sensor,LED, C.

• The main objective is to save the excessive use of electricity as leads unnecessary use of energy.So the light get on when the car passes through and at other time it will be off.

• Used LDR and IR for sensing light and car movement Node MCU for creating an System by applying code for it an connecting this all through PCB.
