Smart Street Light |
• Design and developed a device or system using Node MCU / Raspberry Pi3, LDR sensor, IR sensor,LED, C.
• The main objective is to save the excessive use of electricity as leads unnecessary use of energy.So the light get on when
the car passes through and at other time it will be off.
• Used LDR and IR for sensing light and car movement Node MCU for creating an System by applying code for it an
connecting this all through PCB.
